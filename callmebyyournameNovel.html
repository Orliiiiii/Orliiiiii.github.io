                                It is the summer of 1983. Elio, a 17-year-old Jewish Italo-French young man, lives with his parents
                                in rural Northern Italy.
                            </p>
                            <p>Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old American graduate student, Oliver,
                                who is also Jewish, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork.
                                Elio,an introspective bibliophile and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common
                                with Oliver, who appears confident and carefree.
                            </p>
                            <p>Elio spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his childhood friends,
                                Chiara and Marzia. During a volleyball match, Oliver touches Elio's back as a sign of interest but
                                Elio brushes it off. However, Elio later finds himself jealous upon seeing Oliver pursue Chiara.</p>
                            <p>Elio and Oliver spend more time together, going for long walks into town, and accompanying Elio's
                                father on an archaeological trip.</p>
                            <p> Elio is increasingly drawn to Oliver, even sneaking to Oliver's room to smell his clothing. Elio
                                eventually confesses his feelings to Oliver,who is awestruck and tells him they cannot discuss such
                                things. Later, in a secluded spot, the two kiss for the first time. Oliver is reluctant to take
                                things further and they do not speak for several days.
